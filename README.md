# Pinyin Toolkit Bandaid

[Live Demo](https://pinyin-toolkit-bandaid.chanind.com)

I used [Pinyin Toolkit](http://batterseapower.github.io/pinyin-toolkit/)
for entering Chinese characters into Anki back in Anki 2.x. However, this
plugin hasn't been updated for Anki 2.1, and Anki disabled all support for
syncing with Anki 2.0 in February 2020. So, now I'm stuck and can't input
any new Chinese characters into my Chinese Anki deck since I can't get the
pinyin tone styles to match what's output by Pinyin Toolkit.

This site is a hacky way around this, by allowing me to manually type
pinyin like **ni3hao3**, and have it output proper Anki-compatible HTML
that matches what the old Pinyin Toolkit would have output. This is just a
stopgap until I find a better solution, but if anyone else is in my same
situation, feel free to use this tool too!

## Building

This is just a gatsby site, so you can build it with `yarn install` followed by `yarn build` to build the site, or `yarn start` if you want to just run it locally for development.
